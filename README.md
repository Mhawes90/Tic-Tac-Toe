# Tic-Tac-Toe
First javascript attempt in order to create a tic-tac-toe style game


Going to take an object oriented route with program. Game is going to have 2 player objects (X and O), and the game board is going to be made up of 9 nodes (as of now). Tic-Tac-Toe is going to have the standard rules for victory, IE connect 3 across or diagonal.

The Node objects are going to contain the symbol it holds, IE X or O, and it's location.
The Player object is going to contain it's symbol, and an array of the Nodes for which it has taken.
