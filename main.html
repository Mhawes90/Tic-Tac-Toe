		Some general rules that are being broken here:
		1. You have inline styles here when you don't need them. You should move them all to an external stylesheet.
		2. You have multiple instances of ids on the page. Only 1 DOM node per page should ever use a specific id.
		3. Adding from rule 2, you should use classes when possible.
